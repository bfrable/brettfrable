<p>I bring a unique perspective to front end development and user interface design. Each position I have held has transmuted my skillset and goals towards forward-thinking technology. I am obsessed with expanding my craft, solving challenging problems and staying on the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>I like to work alongside designers to see their vision come to life and pull off pixel perfection. I'm as comfortable mentoring others, <br> as I am learning from them.</p>
